# UPDATE

Starting from [version 1.26](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/releases/tag/v1.26.0) Serverless Framework includes two Golang templates:

* `aws-go` - basic template with two functions
* `aws-go-dep` - **recommended** template using [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) package manager

You can use them with `create` command:

```
serverless create -t aws-go-dep
```
